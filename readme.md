This is a mini-project that I worked on during a break between my classes.
Although it's a very basic project, so easy that it can be considered a simple set of codes instead of a project, I still learned a lot about CSS while working on this project.
I have practiced box models, list styling, typography, and some other elements of CSS to showcase a very simple web page in a very intriguing manner.
I have linked another web page about food quality to allow users to access further information.
The other links for navigation are just there to test the models and methods, I have not attached or linked any web page to them yet.
